  8.15.4 or higher) - Git
</Info>

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gabrielvfonseca/metal.git
cd metal
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Start development mode:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will start all services in development mode:

- CLI application
- Background daemon
- Optional web dashboard

## Available Scripts

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
# Start development mode
pnpm dev

# Build all packages and applications
pnpm build

# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run linting
pnpm lint

# Run type checking
pnpm type-check
```

</CodeGroup>

## Project Structure

Metal is organized as a monorepo with the following structure:

```
metal/
├── apps/
│   ├── cli/                 # Main CLI application
│   ├── daemon/              # Background service
│   └── dashboard/           # Optional web interface
├── packages/
│   ├── core/               # Shared business logic
│   ├── ai/                 # AI integration layer
│   ├── capture/            # State capture utilities
│   ├── config/             # Configuration management
│   └── types/              # Shared TypeScript types
└── tools/
    ├── eslint-config/
    └── tsconfig/
```

## Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your feature or fix:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

2. Make your changes and test them:

```bash
pnpm test
pnpm lint
pnpm type-check
```

3. Commit your changes following the conventional commit format:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
```

4. Push your changes and create a pull request:

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Build errors">
    Try cleaning the build cache and rebuilding: ```bash pnpm clean pnpm build ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Type errors">
    Make sure all dependencies are installed and run type checking: ```bash pnpm install pnpm
    type-check ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Test failures">
    Run tests with verbose output to see more details: ```bash pnpm test --verbose ```
