## Overview

Metal provides a comprehensive API that allows you to integrate its context switching capabilities into your own applications and workflows.

## API Structure

    HTTP endpoints for remote integration
  </Card>

</CardGroup>

## Authentication

Metal uses API keys for authentication. You can generate an API key in the dashboard:

```bash
# Set your API key
export METAL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Or use in requests
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here" https://api.metal.dev/v1/...
```

## Base URL

All API endpoints are relative to the base URL:

```
https://api.metal.dev/v1
```

## Rate Limits

API requests are subject to rate limits:

- 100 requests per minute for standard plans
- 1000 requests per minute for premium plans
- Rate limit headers are included in responses

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes and returns detailed error messages:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "rate_limit_exceeded",
    "message": "Rate limit exceeded",
    "details": {
      "limit": 100,
      "reset": "2024-03-20T12:00:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```

## Versioning

The API is versioned using the URL path. The current version is v1:

```
https://api.metal.dev/v1/...
```

## SDKs

Official SDKs are available for popular languages:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @metal/sdk
```

```bash pip
pip install metal-sdk
```

```bash go
go get github.com/metal/sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

## Examples

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Capture State">
    ```javascript
    const metal = new Metal({
      apiKey: process.env.METAL_API_KEY
    });

    await metal.captureState({
      project: "my-project",
      context: "development"
    });
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Resume Context">
    ```javascript
    const state = await metal.resumeContext({
      project: "my-project",
      from: "2h ago"
    });
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Stream Events">
    ```javascript
    const stream = await metal.streamEvents({
      project: "my-project"
    });

    stream.on("interruption", (event) => {
      console.log("Interruption detected:", event);
    });
    ```

  </Accordion>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Error Handling">
    - Always check for errors - Implement retry logic - Handle rate limits
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Performance">
    - Use appropriate timeouts - Implement caching - Batch requests when possible
