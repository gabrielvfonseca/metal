## AI Integration

Metal uses advanced AI models to analyze your work context:

1. **Natural Language Processing**

   - Understands task descriptions
   - Analyzes communication context
   - Extracts key information

2. **Code Analysis**

   - Identifies project structure
   - Understands code dependencies
   - Tracks development patterns

3. **Workflow Analysis**
   - Maps task relationships
   - Identifies bottlenecks
   - Suggests optimizations

## Configuration

You can customize the AI analysis through environment variables:

```bash
# AI Model Settings
METAL_AI_MODEL=gpt-4
METAL_ANALYSIS_DEPTH=high
METAL_LEARNING_RATE=0.1

# Analysis Features
METAL_ANALYZE_CODE=true
METAL_ANALYZE_COMMS=true
METAL_ANALYZE_WORKFLOW=true
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Improving Accuracy">
    - Provide clear task descriptions - Use consistent naming conventions - Maintain organized
    project structure
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Performance Optimization">
    - Adjust analysis depth based on needs - Schedule heavy analysis during idle time - Use
    appropriate model size
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Inaccurate Analysis">
    If analysis seems incorrect: - Check task descriptions - Verify project structure - Adjust
    analysis parameters
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Performance Issues">
    If analysis is slow: - Reduce analysis depth - Use lighter AI model - Schedule during off-hours
  </Accordion>
