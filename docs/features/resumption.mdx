## How It Works

Metal's resumption system follows these steps:

1. **State Recovery**

   - Restores open files and positions
   - Recovers terminal state
   - Reinstates editor settings

2. **Context Restoration**

   - Rebuilds work environment
   - Restores project context
   - Reconnects dependencies

3. **Intelligent Assistance**
   - Suggests next actions
   - Highlights important changes
   - Provides relevant reminders

## Usage

Use the following commands to manage resumption:

```bash
# Basic resumption
metal resume

# Resume specific context
metal resume --context "feature-x"

# Time-based resumption
metal resume --since "2h ago"
```

## Configuration

Customize resumption behavior through environment variables:

```bash
# Resumption Settings
METAL_RESUME_AUTO=true
METAL_RESUME_DEPTH=high
METAL_RESUME_NOTIFY=true

# Notification Settings
METAL_NOTIFY_BEFORE=5m
METAL_NOTIFY_CHANNEL=desktop
```

## Best Practices
